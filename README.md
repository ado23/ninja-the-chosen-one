# Ninja The Chosen One

Like so many things distinctly human, video games were born out of a combination of innovation, necessity and curiosity. Video games represent the ultimate form of art because they combine almost every possible form of the art as a whole. This project is made out of pure hobby and curiosity. Full development of 2D platform video game is made in **Unity game engine** for a computer that runs on **Windows** operating system. The **2D platformer** is type of video game where the whole gameplay revolves around the player who controls the character, that can **move** in 2D world, **attack** the enemies and **jump** on various platforms.

## Description

_"Live in your world, play in ours" - Playstation_

The story of this game revolves around main character that has ability to attack enemies with his sword and to jump over them in order to finish the level. <br/>
The inspiration for the game lies in old **2D NES games** like: [Ninja Gaiden](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_(NES_video_game)>), [Double Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dragon_III:_The_Sacred_Stones), [Kick Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_Master), etc... <br/> Character can also jump on various moving or static platforms or even on some type of enemies (Turret for example). The game also has some hidden areas with additional coins that boost your final score. There are total of 4 enemies in the game:
Passive: **TileShooter, Turret**,
Active: **Zombie, QuickMan**.
But you can also lose your life in the game if you step on **spikes** or you drop in **water** (those are instakills in game). TileShooter is the type of enemy that only shows if our character comes in its line of view, otherwise it is hidden under the grass. Character can also run into **checkpoints** and activate them once he is trough, so when he dies he will restart at the last available checkpoint.

This project needs to be imported into Unity game engine. The version used at the moment of developing this was: **(2017.4.36f1)**. Once the import process is done you can build it and you will get build folder with exe file to run the game.

## Try out

If you are interested only in running the game without downloading and installing entire game engine that is also possible by downloading **MasterBuild** folder that contains **exe file**. Then you only run that file and you should be prompted with window with additional configuration like: screen size, graphics and buttons configuration. The game is optimized to run on Windows machine.
